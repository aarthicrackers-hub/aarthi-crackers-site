# Assets Directory

This directory is reserved for static assets like images, icons, and other media files.

## Current Status
- No images are currently used in the application
- All product displays use emoji icons and gradient backgrounds
- The design is fully functional without external image dependencies

## Future Image Integration
If you want to add product images later, you can:
1. Add product images to this directory
2. Update the Product interface in `src/data/products.ts` to include an `image` field
3. Modify the ProductCard component to display images instead of emoji icons

## Current Design
- Products are displayed with category-specific emoji icons
- Color-coded backgrounds for different product categories
- Clean, modern design without image dependencies
